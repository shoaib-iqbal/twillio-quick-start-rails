# Twilio Multiparty Video Quickstart for JavaScript and Rails

Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

- Account SID: Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/console).
- API Key SID: Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/api-keys).
- API Key Secret: Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/api-keys).
cp .env.template .env
bundle install
rails s
http://localhost:3000/calls
you can run the ngrock to see how it will look on multiple user or you can use new private window just make sure room name should be the same to connect
